### Hello there, I'm Wythor - aka wy7 👋

## I'm a Student, Musician and Developer!

- 🏬 I’m currently working on [Smarkets][sm] as Fullstack Developer (migrating to backend software engineer) ( using .Net Core and Angular).
- 🔭 I'm in the 8th Semester of Computer Science on UNINOVE (my last semester!!! thanks god)
- 🌱 I'm currently doing [Fullcycle 2.0][fullcycle] training

### Soft Skills (How is working with me?) 👨‍💻 :
- I use to think first in "why do it?", than "how do it?".
- Im result driven since i worked on McDonald's :)
- I appreciate the organization of my things and my code.
- I love working as a team, and feeling part of something bigger. 
- I respond quickly in severe cases. Like a firefighter. First we put out the fire, then we study the cause, and we set up/execute a strategy so that it doesn't happen again. 
- Im always open to new technologies and possibilities, as long as there is a technical and empirical basis, because I'll also have it haha :D
- Im always studying new techniques and technologies, so that as soon as necessary, I can present them and, if feasible, implement them.
